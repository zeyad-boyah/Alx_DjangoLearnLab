# Alx Django Learn Lab

Welcome to the **Alx Django Learn Lab** repository! This collection of projects documents my learning journey with Django and Django REST Framework (DRF). It covers a range of topics from fundamental Django concepts to advanced API design and implementation.

## Overview

This repository is designed to:
- Showcase hands-on projects and exercises that reinforce the concepts of Django web development.
- Demonstrate the practical application of Django REST Framework for building robust, production-ready APIs.
- Serve as a personal portfolio of my progression in web development, focusing on both front-end and back-end techniques.

## Repository Contents

Each project  inside this repository focuses on different aspects of Django and DRF:

- **Django Fundamentals:**  
  Projects that introduce core Django concepts including project structure, routing, views, models, and template rendering.

- **RESTful API Development:**  
  Exercises and projects that use Django REST Framework to create APIs with CRUD operations, serialization, viewsets, and routers.

- **Authentication & Authorization:**  
  Examples demonstrating secure user authentication approaches (e.g., JWT and session-based) and permission handling.
